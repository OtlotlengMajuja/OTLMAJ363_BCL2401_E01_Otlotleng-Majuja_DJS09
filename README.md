# DJS09 Project: Couch Surfing

## Introduction

In this project, I was required to build an application that alllows users to browse different properties in various countries using TypeScript.

## Project Overview

This is a Typescript-based web application, for a property browsing website called Couch Surfing. The focus for this project will be to understand the concepts around a JavaScript superset like Typescript and to get a feel for how it works.

## Elements Included

**Navigation Bar:** Helps users navigate the page.
**Reviews section:** provides information about the properties that are being listed
**Properties:** Users can view the properties in the different parts of the world for themselves.

## Reflections

### Areas of Mastery

**Creating and Managing Components:** I gained an elementary understanding of creating reusable components, like property cards and review cards, ensuring maintainable and scalable code.

**Event Handling:** improved Event handling capabilities such as the ability to dynamically add reviews to the website by adding click events to buttons.

**Utilizing Utility Functions:** Gained proficiency in using utility functions (`showReviewTotal`, `populateUser`, `showDetails`, `getTopTwoReviews`) improve functionality and simplify code.

### Challenges Faced

Installing the TypeScript packages correctly and managing complicated data structures like type alias, and enumerations posed a significant problem.

### Overall Learning Experience

If I claimed to have a greater understanding of Typescript's real functionality after working on this project, I would be lying. Although I acknowledge that this effort may not have been essential, I thought there was no reason to spend four days figuring out how to install the packages properly if it would just broaden our understanding of JavaScript.
